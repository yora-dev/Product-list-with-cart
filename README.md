## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **state management** for cart functionality.  
I learned how to:

- Manage cart items using React state
- Implement an **order confirmation modal**
- Reset the application state for a fresh order
- Combine **flexbox and grid** for a responsive product layout

### Continued development

**In the future, Iâ€™d like to:**

- Add localStorage persistence so the cart remains after refresh
- Improve animations for adding/removing items and showing the modal
- Explore integrating a real checkout flow with a backend API

### Useful resources

- MDN - Array methods
